| Phase | Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 109 | CLI foundation + command structure | ✅ | Click CLI, subcommands, 3-tier subscription system ($19/$99/$299), tier command, 41 tests |
| 122 | Vehicle garage management + photo intake | ✅ | Migration 013 + src/motodiag/intake/ package. VehicleIdentifier with Claude Haiku 4.5 vision, Sonnet escalation < 0.5 confidence, sha256 image cache, 1024px Pillow resize, tier caps 20/200/unlimited enforced from subscriptions.tier, 80% budget alert on crossing. CLI: garage add/list/remove, garage add-from-photo, intake photo, intake quota. 49 tests, all vision calls mocked (0 tokens burned), 2051 total, zero regressions. Schema v12→v13. |
| 123 | Interactive diagnostic session | ✅ | New cli/diagnose.py orchestration + 4 CLI subcommands (start/quick/list/show). Q&A loop caps at 3 rounds, stops on confidence ≥ 0.7. Tier-gated model access (individual=Haiku; shop/company=Sonnet). No migration — reuses Phase 03 substrate. 39 tests, all mocked (0 tokens), 2090 total, zero regressions. |
| 124 | Fault code lookup command | ✅ | New `cli/code.py` (392 LoC) replaces Phase 01's inline `code` command via `register_code(cli)` with legacy-eviction guard. Single command, three modes: default DB lookup with fallback chain (make-specific → generic → `classify_code()` heuristic + yellow banner), `--category <cat>` list mode (via Phase 111's `get_dtcs_by_category`), and `--explain --vehicle-id N` tier-gated AI interpretation (`FaultCodeInterpreter`). Reuses `_resolve_model/_load_vehicle/_load_known_issues/_parse_symptoms` from `cli.diagnose` — no copy-paste. Phase 05 `test_code_help` updated to use `--help`. 33 tests, all mocked (0 tokens), 2123 total, zero regressions. |
| 125 | Quick diagnosis mode | ✅ | Extended `cli/diagnose.py` (+180 LoC): `_parse_slug` + `_resolve_bike_slug` (4-tier match), `--bike SLUG` option on `diagnose quick`, new top-level `motodiag quick "<symptoms>"` via `register_quick` + Click `ctx.invoke()` delegation. Pure UX sugar — no substrate. First agent-delegated build (Builder-A). 34 tests, 2157 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 126 | Diagnostic report output | ✅ | Extended `cli/diagnose.py` (+200 LoC): 3 pure formatters (txt/json/md) + `--format` and `--output` options on existing `diagnose show`. JSON has `format_version: "1"` for future schema evolution. Second agent-delegated phase. 22 tests, 2179 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 127 | Session history browser | ✅ | Migration 014 adds nullable `notes` column (schema v13→v14). Extended `diagnose list` with 7 new filter options (vehicle-id/make/model/search/since/until/limit), new `diagnose reopen <id>` and `diagnose annotate <id> "note"` commands. Append-only notes with timestamp prefix. Third agent-delegated phase. 28 tests, 2207 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 128 | Knowledge base browser | ✅ | New `cli/kb.py` (~320 LoC) + new `search_known_issues_text` repo function. 5 subcommands under `motodiag kb`: list (structured filters), show, search (free-text across title/description/symptoms), by-symptom, by-code (DTC upper-cased). Fourth agent-delegated phase. 26 tests, 2233 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 129 | Rich terminal UI (tables, colors, progress) | ✅ | New `cli/theme.py` (~230 LoC) centralizes Console singleton + color maps (severity/status/tier) + icons + spinner context. Migrated 10+ inline `Console()` sites across 5 CLI modules. Progress spinners wrap AI calls (diagnose, code --explain, intake). Respects `NO_COLOR` + `COLUMNS`. Textual TUI explicitly deferred. 20 tests, 2253 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 130 | Shell completions + shortcuts | ✅ | New `cli/completion.py` (~260 LoC) wraps Click's shell completion + adds 3 dynamic completers (bike slugs / DTC codes / session IDs), defensive on fresh DB. 4 hidden short aliases (d/k/g/q) via shallow-copy pattern. `shell_complete=` wired on 6 existing option sites. Sixth agent-delegated phase. 18 tests, 2271 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 131 | Offline mode | ✅ | Migration 015 adds `ai_response_cache` (schema v14→v15). New `engine/cache.py` (SHA256 keys) + `cli/cache.py` (stats/purge/clear). `--offline` flag on `diagnose quick/start` + `code --explain`. Cache misses on `--offline` raise clear RuntimeError. Seventh agent-delegated phase. 30 tests, 2301 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 132 | Export + sharing | ✅ | Extends Phase 126 `--format` with `html` and `pdf` on `diagnose show` + brings `kb show` to parity (md/html/pdf). New `cli/export.py` shared module (`format_as_html` via `markdown`, `format_as_pdf` via `xhtml2pdf`). `motodiag[export]` optional extras. Markdown is the pivot format. Eighth agent-delegated phase. 25 tests, 2326 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 133 | Gate 5 — CLI integration test | ✅ | **GATE 5 PASSED.** Single new test file `test_phase133_gate_5.py` (~7 tests across 3 classes): one big end-to-end workflow test with 19 CLI invocations on shared DB + `CliRunner` + 3 AI mocks (`_default_diagnose_fn` / `_default_interpret_fn` / `_default_vision_call`), 4 CLI-surface breadth tests, 2 regression tests (Gate R still passes, schema ≥ v15, all `cli.*` submodules import). Consolidated 15-20 planned tests into 7 cohesive ones (same pattern as Gate R's 20→10). Ninth agent-delegated phase — Builder-A clean first pass, 7 tests passed in 6.04s on trust-but-verify. Zero new production code (pure observation), zero schema changes, zero live tokens. 2333 total. |

## Retrofit Track — Codebase Expansion Preparation (Phases 110–121)

## Track E — Hardware Interface (Phases 134–147) ✅ COMPLETE

OBD adapter integration, live sensor data, ECU communication. Shifted from 122-135 due to Retrofit track insertion.

| Phase | Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 134 | OBD protocol abstraction layer | ✅ | New `hardware/protocols/` package: `base.py` (`ProtocolAdapter` ABC — connect/disconnect/is_connected/read_dtcs/clear_dtcs/read_pid/read_vin/send_raw/get_protocol_name), `models.py` (`ProtocolConnection` frozen Pydantic model + `DTCReadResult` with `mode="before"` uppercase normalization + `PIDResponse` paired value/unit validator), `exceptions.py` (`ProtocolError` base + `ConnectionError` + `TimeoutError` + `UnsupportedCommandError(command)`). Wave 1 Builder (parallel dispatch) delivered clean first pass. No migration, no CLI. 49 tests, 2382 total. |
| 135 | ELM327 adapter communication | ✅ | New `hardware/protocols/elm327.py` (~584 LoC) — first concrete `ProtocolAdapter`. Wraps ELM327 OBD-II chip over pyserial (serial/USB/Bluetooth-SPP) with full AT-command handshake (`ATZ`/`ATE0`/`ATL0`/`ATSP0`), multi-frame response tolerance (scans for `43`/`41 XX` service echo rather than index 0), DTC parsing (mode 03 response → P/B/C/U codes), VIN assembly (mode 09 PID 02 multi-line). Unlocks ~80% of aftermarket OBD dongles (OBDLink, Vgate, generic clones). Wave 2 Builder. 52 tests. |
| 136 | CAN bus protocol implementation | ✅ | New `hardware/protocols/can.py` (~470 LoC). ISO 15765-4 over `python-can` (any backend — SocketCAN/PCAN/Vector/Kvaser/slcan/Peak). Hand-rolled ISO-TP (not `python-can-isotp` — fewer Windows-fragile deps). Services: mode 03 DTCs, mode 04 clear (`True` on positive, `False` on NRC 0x22, raises on others), mode 09 VIN, read_pid with big-endian byte combination. New `can = ["python-can>=4.0"]` optional extras. Target bikes: 2011+ Harley Touring, modern CAN-equipped Japanese/EU bikes. Wave 2 Builder. 38 tests. |
| 137 | K-line/KWP2000 protocol implementation | ✅ | New `hardware/protocols/kline.py` (~670 LoC) — ISO 14230-4 over pyserial for 90s/2000s Japanese sport-bikes (CBR/ZX/GSX-R/YZF-R1) and vintage Euro (Aprilia RSV, Ducati 996, KTM LC4). Module-level pure `_build_frame`/`_parse_frame` helpers for testability. Slow-baud wakeup, checksum validation, local-echo cancellation, strict timing windows. Services 0x10/0x11/0x14/0x18/0x1A/0x21. DTC decode (`(0x02, 0x01) → P0201`). Write services (0x27/0x2E/0x31) deliberately out of scope (tune-writing safety). Wave 2 Builder. 44 tests. |
| 138 | J1850 protocol implementation | ✅ | New `hardware/protocols/j1850.py` (~600 LoC) — J1850 VPW (10.4 kbps) for pre-2011 Harley. No direct bit-bang; talks through bridge devices (ScanGauge II, Daytona Twin Tec, Dynojet Power Commander, Digital Tech II clones). Multi-module DTC read merges ECM (P-codes) + BCM (B-codes) + ABS (C-codes) into single list, with supplementary `read_dtcs_by_module() -> dict`. Bridge variants: `daytona/scangauge/dynojet/generic`. `read_pid` raises `NotImplementedError` (Phase 141); `read_vin` raises `UnsupportedCommandError` (pre-2008 HDs lacked Mode 09). Wave 2 Builder. 27 tests. |
| 139 | ECU auto-detection + handshake | ✅ | New `hardware/ecu_detect.py` (~460 LoC). `AutoDetector` given a serial port + optional `make_hint` tries protocol adapters in priority order (Harley→J1850 first; Japanese→CAN/KWP2000; European→CAN/KWP2000; unknown→all four) until one negotiates. Per-protocol `_build_adapter` factory handles non-uniform adapter kwargs (each of CAN/K-line/J1850/ELM327 has different constructor signature). Lazy per-adapter imports so missing optional deps only surface when tried. `identify_ecu()` probes VIN + ECU part number + software version + supported OBD modes, each best-effort. `NoECUDetectedError` carries `port`, `make_hint`, and `errors: list[(name, exception)]` for introspection. No live hardware — all tests use `MagicMock` adapters. Wave 3 Builder. 31 tests. |
| 140 | Fault code read/clear operations | ✅ | First user-facing Track E phase. New `motodiag hardware` CLI group with `scan` (auto-detect + Mode 03 read + Rich table with 3-tier DTC enrichment), `clear` (Mode 04 with yellow safety warning + confirm/`--yes`), `info` (`identify_ecu()` → Rich Panel with VIN/ECU#/sw/modes). 5 new files: `hardware/mock.py` (249 LoC `MockAdapter` ABC-satisfying with configurable state), `hardware/connection.py` (255 LoC `HardwareSession` context manager — real/mock/override paths + disconnect-on-exception), `knowledge/dtc_lookup.py` (147 LoC `resolve_dtc_info` with `source=db_make/db_generic/classifier` discriminator), `cli/hardware.py` (556 LoC), `test_phase140_hardware_cli.py` (40 tests across 6 classes). `--mock` flag bypasses pyserial entirely for CI/offline dev. Tenth agent-delegated phase — Builder-A's cleanest pass (no sandbox block, 40 tests in 21.24s, zero iterative fixes). 2614 total. |
| 141 | Live sensor data streaming | ✅ | New `hardware/sensors.py` (SAE J1979 PID catalog + `SensorSpec`/`SensorReading`/`SensorStreamer` one-shot iterator) + `motodiag hardware stream --port --pids --hz --duration --output` subcommand with Rich `Live` panel + optional CSV append logging. `MockAdapter.pid_values` additive kwarg. 42 tests GREEN. Bug fix #1: hz-throttle test (generator post-yield sleep semantics). |
| 142 | Data logging + recording | ✅ | Migration 016 (schema v15→v16): `sensor_recordings` + `sensor_samples` + 4 indexes (FK CASCADE). New `hardware/recorder.py` (`RecordingManager` with SQLite/JSONL split at 1000 rows, transparent load merge, linear-interp `DiffReport` via stdlib `bisect`). `motodiag hardware log {start,stop,list,show,replay,diff,export,prune}` 8-subcommand subgroup. `parquet = [pyarrow]` optional extra. 52 tests GREEN. |
| 143 | Real-time terminal dashboard | ✅ | New `hardware/dashboard.py` (1282 LoC — `DashboardApp(textual.App)` with 3-column grid + ctrl+q/ctrl+r/d/1-6 keybindings, `GaugeWidget`/`PidChart`/`DTCPanel`/`StatusBar`, `LiveDashboardSource` wrapping SensorStreamer + `ReplayDashboardSource` walking recordings). `motodiag hardware dashboard` subcommand. `dashboard = [textual>=0.40,<1.0]` optional extra. Lazy Textual import with install-hint. 46 tests GREEN. Bug fix #1: `GaugeWidget` numeric display used unclamped value. |
| 144 | Hardware simulator | ✅ | New `hardware/simulator.py` (1212 LoC — `SimulationClock` manual-tick, 9 Pydantic discriminated-union event models, `Scenario` aggregate with cross-event validators, `ScenarioLoader` from_yaml/from_recording/list_builtins, `SimulatedAdapter(ProtocolAdapter)` sibling to MockAdapter). 10 built-in YAML scenarios under `scenarios/`. `motodiag hardware simulate {list,run,validate}` + `--simulator SCENARIO` opt-in on scan/clear/info. `pyyaml>=6` base dep + `package-data` for YAMLs. 81 tests GREEN. Bug fix #1: `_coerce_pid` bare-number → decimal (JSON round-trip identity). |
| 145 | Adapter compatibility database | ✅ | Migration 017 (schema v16→v17): `obd_adapters` + `adapter_compatibility` + `compat_notes` + 6 indexes. New `hardware/compat_repo.py` (870 LoC CRUD + ranking + `check_compatibility` specificity match + `protocols_to_skip_for_make` AutoDetector filter hook) + `compat_loader.py` (idempotent JSON seed). Seed data: 24 real adapters (OBDLink MX+/SX/LX, Dynojet PV3, Daytona TCFI, Vance & Hines FP4, Autel AP200BT, Foxwell NT301, Vgate iCar Pro, HD Digital Tech II, 24 total) + 110 compat matrix rows + 12 curated notes. `motodiag hardware compat {list,recommend,check,show,note,seed}`. AutoDetector gets `compat_repo=None` kwarg (Phase 139 backward-compat preserved). 57 tests GREEN. Bug fix #1: TestCompatCLI fixture three-layer db_path redirect. Bug fix #2: compat_notes.json `obdlink-cx` → `scantool-obdlink-cx` slug. |
| 146 | Connection troubleshooting + recovery | ✅ | `hardware/connection.py` +446 LoC: `RetryPolicy` Pydantic model (exponential-with-clamp backoff) + `ResilientAdapter` wrapper (retries transient wire ops, never retries `UnsupportedCommandError`/`NoECUDetectedError`/`clear_dtcs`) + `HardwareSession` `retry_policy`/`auto_reconnect` kwargs + `try_reconnect()` helper. AutoDetector `verbose` + `on_attempt` callback kwargs. `MockAdapter.flaky_rate` + `flaky_seed` for deterministic retry tests. `motodiag hardware diagnose` 5-step troubleshooter (port open / ATZ probe / AutoDetector negotiate / VIN read / DTC scan) with mechanic-readable Rich-panel remediation. `--retry`/`--no-retry` on scan/info (default on), clear (default off). 56 tests GREEN. Bug fix #1: `MockAdapter` lazy-import in diagnose `--mock` branch. Bug fix #2: `--retry`/`--simulator` mutex → silent retry=False. |
| 147 | Gate 6 — Hardware integration test | ✅ | **GATE 6 PASSED — Track E closed.** New `tests/test_phase147_gate_6.py` (875 LoC, 8 tests across 3 classes, zero production code). Class A: one big CliRunner workflow — `garage add` → `compat seed/recommend` → `hardware info/scan --simulator` → `hardware log start/list/show/replay/export` → `hardware stream` → `hardware diagnose --mock` → `hardware clear --simulator`. Shared DB fixture + 3 defensive AI mocks + `time.sleep` no-ops. Class B: 4 surface tests verify 9-subcommand registration + subgroup children + `--help` + submodule import graph. Class C: 3 regression tests — subprocess re-runs of Gate 5 + Gate R + tiered schema floor `>= 15/16/17`. 8 tests GREEN. Bug fix #1: `CliRunner(mix_stderr=False)` removed in Click 8.2+. Bug fix #2: `FROM recordings` → `FROM sensor_recordings`. |

## Track F — Advanced Diagnostics (Phases 148–159)

| Phase | Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 148 | Predictive maintenance | ✅ | **First Track F phase.** Promotes `advanced` package Scaffold → Active. New `advanced/models.py` (frozen Pydantic v2 `FailurePrediction` + `PredictionConfidence` enum), `advanced/predictor.py` (395 LoC — `predict_failures(vehicle, horizon_days, min_severity, db_path)` with 4-pass candidate retrieval, match-tier scoring exact_model=1.0/family=0.75/make=0.5/generic=0.3, severity-keyed heuristic onset critical=15k/high=30k/medium=50k/low=80k mi, mileage + age scoring bonuses, Forum-tip-precedence `preventive_action` extraction, `verified_by` substring heuristic, horizon/severity filters, stable sort cap 50). `motodiag advanced predict --bike SLUG \| --make/--model/--year/--current-miles [--horizon-days] [--min-severity] [--json]`.

| 153 | Parts cross-reference | ✅ | Migration 021: `parts` + `parts_xref` tables. `advanced/parts_repo.py` + `parts_loader.py` with OEM ↔ aftermarket catalog. `predictor.py` populates `parts_cost_cents` on FailurePrediction. `motodiag advanced parts {search,xref,show,seed}`. 31 tests GREEN. |
| 154 | OEM Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) | ✅ | Migration 022: `technical_service_bulletins` with SQL LIKE `model_pattern` + partial unique index. `advanced/tsb_repo.py` (466 LoC) + 44 real HD/Honda/Yamaha entries seeded. Auto-seed on `init_db()`. `predictor.py` `applicable_tsbs` via 4-char token overlap + severity bucket-adjacency. `motodiag advanced tsb {list,search,show,by-make}`. 32 tests GREEN. |
| 155 | NHTSA safety recalls | ✅ | Migration 023: extends `recalls` with nhtsa_id/vin_range/open + new `recall_resolutions` junction. `advanced/recall_repo.py` (603 LoC) with VIN validation + range check + WMI decode + resolutions. `predictor.py` `applicable_recalls` + critical-severity escalation. `motodiag advanced recall {list,check-vin,lookup,mark-resolved}`. 31 tests GREEN. |
| 156 | Comparative diagnostics | ✅ | No migration. `advanced/comparative.py` (709 LoC) two-stage reduction — per-recording summary → percentile across recordings. `--peers-min 5` noisy-stats guard. 200-row cohort cap. `motodiag advanced compare {bike,recording,fleet}`. 34 tests GREEN. |
| 157 | Healthy baselines | ✅ | Migration 024: `baselines` table with per-(make, model, year, pid) percentile statistics aggregated from mechanic-flagged-healthy recordings. `motodiag advanced baseline {show,flag-healthy,rebuild,list}`. 31 tests GREEN. |

Zero new production code. |

## Track G — Shop Management + Optimization (Phases 160–174)

Shop-level features: log bikes in your shop, track issues across the fleet, triage what to fix first, auto-generate parts lists, optimize workflow. Shifted from 148-162 due to Retrofit track insertion.

| Phase | Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|

## Track H — API + Web Layer (Phases 175–184)

REST API for future mobile app / web dashboard. Paywall enforcement flips to HARD mode here. Shifted from 163-172 due to Retrofit track insertion.

| Phase | Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 175 | FastAPI foundation + project structure | 🔲 | API scaffold, CORS, error handling (was 163) |

## Track I — Mobile App (iOS + Android) (Phases 185–204)

**Distribution:** iOS App Store + Google Play Store (paid app or freemium)
**Framework:** React Native (single codebase → both platforms, broad device support)

Full-featured mobile app for mechanics in the field. Same capabilities as desktop — not a stripped-down version. Designed for dirty hands, loud shops, and outdoor use.

### Device Support Requirements
- **iOS:** iPhone 8 and later (iOS 15+) — covers ~99% of active iPhones
- **Android:** Android 8.0 (Oreo) and later — covers old Samsungs, budget phones, tablets
- **Screen sizes:** 4.7" to 12.9" — phone and tablet layouts
- **Orientation:** portrait default, landscape for live sensor dashboard
- **Performance:** must run smoothly on budget Android devices ($100-200 phones)

### Design Principles (Mobile)
- **Big touch targets** — fat fingers in gloves, greasy hands, minimum 48dp tap areas
- **Voice input** — describe symptoms by talking, not typing
- **Camera + video** — film running bike, photograph parts, scan VINs
- **Offline-first** — works without internet, syncs when connected
- **Bluetooth OBD** — connect to bike adapter directly from phone
- **Low bandwidth** — works on 3G/LTE, not just WiFi — compressed API responses

## Design Principles

1. **Core depends on nothing** — no framework imports in business logic
2. **Hardware is optional** — full diagnostic value without plugging anything in
3. **Mechanic-first UX** — terse, useful output; no fluff
4. **Every diagnosis is traceable** — session → symptoms → reasoning → conclusion
5. **Knowledge compounds** — each diagnostic session can improve future diagnoses
6. **Cost-aware AI** — track tokens, use cheapest model that works, cache aggressively
