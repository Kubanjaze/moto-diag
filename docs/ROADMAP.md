| Phase | Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 109 | CLI foundation + command structure | ✅ | Click CLI, subcommands, 3-tier subscription system ($19/$99/$299), tier command, 41 tests |
| 122 | Vehicle garage management + photo intake | ✅ | Migration 013 + src/motodiag/intake/ package. VehicleIdentifier with Claude Haiku 4.5 vision, Sonnet escalation < 0.5 confidence, sha256 image cache, 1024px Pillow resize, tier caps 20/200/unlimited enforced from subscriptions.tier, 80% budget alert on crossing. CLI: garage add/list/remove, garage add-from-photo, intake photo, intake quota. 49 tests, all vision calls mocked (0 tokens burned), 2051 total, zero regressions. Schema v12→v13. |
| 123 | Interactive diagnostic session | ✅ | New cli/diagnose.py orchestration + 4 CLI subcommands (start/quick/list/show). Q&A loop caps at 3 rounds, stops on confidence ≥ 0.7. Tier-gated model access (individual=Haiku; shop/company=Sonnet). No migration — reuses Phase 03 substrate. 39 tests, all mocked (0 tokens), 2090 total, zero regressions. |
| 124 | Fault code lookup command | ✅ | New `cli/code.py` (392 LoC) replaces Phase 01's inline `code` command via `register_code(cli)` with legacy-eviction guard. Single command, three modes: default DB lookup with fallback chain (make-specific → generic → `classify_code()` heuristic + yellow banner), `--category <cat>` list mode (via Phase 111's `get_dtcs_by_category`), and `--explain --vehicle-id N` tier-gated AI interpretation (`FaultCodeInterpreter`). Reuses `_resolve_model/_load_vehicle/_load_known_issues/_parse_symptoms` from `cli.diagnose` — no copy-paste. Phase 05 `test_code_help` updated to use `--help`. 33 tests, all mocked (0 tokens), 2123 total, zero regressions. |
| 125 | Quick diagnosis mode | ✅ | Extended `cli/diagnose.py` (+180 LoC): `_parse_slug` + `_resolve_bike_slug` (4-tier match), `--bike SLUG` option on `diagnose quick`, new top-level `motodiag quick "<symptoms>"` via `register_quick` + Click `ctx.invoke()` delegation. Pure UX sugar — no substrate. First agent-delegated build (Builder-A). 34 tests, 2157 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 126 | Diagnostic report output | ✅ | Extended `cli/diagnose.py` (+200 LoC): 3 pure formatters (txt/json/md) + `--format` and `--output` options on existing `diagnose show`. JSON has `format_version: "1"` for future schema evolution. Second agent-delegated phase. 22 tests, 2179 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 127 | Session history browser | ✅ | Migration 014 adds nullable `notes` column (schema v13→v14). Extended `diagnose list` with 7 new filter options (vehicle-id/make/model/search/since/until/limit), new `diagnose reopen <id>` and `diagnose annotate <id> "note"` commands. Append-only notes with timestamp prefix. Third agent-delegated phase. 28 tests, 2207 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 128 | Knowledge base browser | ✅ | New `cli/kb.py` (~320 LoC) + new `search_known_issues_text` repo function. 5 subcommands under `motodiag kb`: list (structured filters), show, search (free-text across title/description/symptoms), by-symptom, by-code (DTC upper-cased). Fourth agent-delegated phase. 26 tests, 2233 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 129 | Rich terminal UI (tables, colors, progress) | ✅ | New `cli/theme.py` (~230 LoC) centralizes Console singleton + color maps (severity/status/tier) + icons + spinner context. Migrated 10+ inline `Console()` sites across 5 CLI modules. Progress spinners wrap AI calls (diagnose, code --explain, intake). Respects `NO_COLOR` + `COLUMNS`. Textual TUI explicitly deferred. 20 tests, 2253 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 130 | Shell completions + shortcuts | ✅ | New `cli/completion.py` (~260 LoC) wraps Click's shell completion + adds 3 dynamic completers (bike slugs / DTC codes / session IDs), defensive on fresh DB. 4 hidden short aliases (d/k/g/q) via shallow-copy pattern. `shell_complete=` wired on 6 existing option sites. Sixth agent-delegated phase. 18 tests, 2271 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 131 | Offline mode | ✅ | Migration 015 adds `ai_response_cache` (schema v14→v15). New `engine/cache.py` (SHA256 keys) + `cli/cache.py` (stats/purge/clear). `--offline` flag on `diagnose quick/start` + `code --explain`. Cache misses on `--offline` raise clear RuntimeError. Seventh agent-delegated phase. 30 tests, 2301 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 132 | Export + sharing | ✅ | Extends Phase 126 `--format` with `html` and `pdf` on `diagnose show` + brings `kb show` to parity (md/html/pdf). New `cli/export.py` shared module (`format_as_html` via `markdown`, `format_as_pdf` via `xhtml2pdf`). `motodiag[export]` optional extras. Markdown is the pivot format. Eighth agent-delegated phase. 25 tests, 2326 total, zero regressions, zero live tokens. |
| 133 | Gate 5 — CLI integration test | ✅ | **GATE 5 PASSED.** Single new test file `test_phase133_gate_5.py` (~7 tests across 3 classes): one big end-to-end workflow test with 19 CLI invocations on shared DB + `CliRunner` + 3 AI mocks (`_default_diagnose_fn` / `_default_interpret_fn` / `_default_vision_call`), 4 CLI-surface breadth tests, 2 regression tests (Gate R still passes, schema ≥ v15, all `cli.*` submodules import). Consolidated 15-20 planned tests into 7 cohesive ones (same pattern as Gate R's 20→10). Ninth agent-delegated phase — Builder-A clean first pass, 7 tests passed in 6.04s on trust-but-verify. Zero new production code (pure observation), zero schema changes, zero live tokens. 2333 total. |

## Retrofit Track — Codebase Expansion Preparation (Phases 110–121)

| 116 | Feedback/learning hooks | ✅ | Migration 009 + feedback/ package (FeedbackOutcome enum, OverrideField enum, DiagnosticFeedback + SessionOverride models, 8 repo functions, FeedbackReader read-only hook). diagnostic_feedback + session_overrides tables with FK CASCADE. Schema v8→v9. 26 tests, 1867 total |
| 117 | Reference data tables | ✅ | Migration 010 + reference/ package (4 enums, 4 models, 4 repo modules × 5 CRUD = 20 functions). 4 new tables with 8 indexes, year-range filter reused from known_issues pattern. Schema v9→v10. 28 tests, 1895 total |
| 118 | Billing/invoicing/inventory/scheduling substrate | ✅ | Migration 011 + 4 new packages (billing/accounting/inventory/scheduling). 9 tables + 14 indexes. Stripe column pre-wiring, invoice recalc with tax, low-stock alerts, calendar-ready appointments. Schema v10→v11. 37 tests, 1932 total |
| 119 | Media annotation layer | ✅ | Migration 012 + media/photo_annotation module (AnnotationShape enum 4 members, PhotoAnnotation model with 3 validators, 8 repo functions). photo_annotations table with 3 indexes. Dual-mode: FK-linked CASCADE or orphan-safe by image_ref. Schema v11→v12. 22 tests, 1954 total |
| 120 | Engine sound signature library expansion | ✅ | 4 new EngineType enum + SIGNATURES entries (ELECTRIC_MOTOR, DUCATI_L_TWIN, KTM_LC8_V_TWIN, TRIUMPH_TRIPLE). motor_rpm_to_whine_frequency helper. Dry-clutch-as-normal documented. 3 Phase 98 forward-compat test fixes. 38 tests, 1992 total |

## Track E — Hardware Interface (Phases 134–147) ✅ COMPLETE

OBD adapter integration, live sensor data, ECU communication. Shifted from 122-135 due to Retrofit track insertion.

| Phase | Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 134 | OBD protocol abstraction layer | ✅ | New `hardware/protocols/` package: `base.py` (`ProtocolAdapter` ABC — connect/disconnect/is_connected/read_dtcs/clear_dtcs/read_pid/read_vin/send_raw/get_protocol_name), `models.py` (`ProtocolConnection` frozen Pydantic model + `DTCReadResult` with `mode="before"` uppercase normalization + `PIDResponse` paired value/unit validator), `exceptions.py` (`ProtocolError` base + `ConnectionError` + `TimeoutError` + `UnsupportedCommandError(command)`). Wave 1 Builder (parallel dispatch) delivered clean first pass. No migration, no CLI. 49 tests, 2382 total. |
| 135 | ELM327 adapter communication | ✅ | New `hardware/protocols/elm327.py` (~584 LoC) — first concrete `ProtocolAdapter`. Wraps ELM327 OBD-II chip over pyserial (serial/USB/Bluetooth-SPP) with full AT-command handshake (`ATZ`/`ATE0`/`ATL0`/`ATSP0`), multi-frame response tolerance (scans for `43`/`41 XX` service echo rather than index 0), DTC parsing (mode 03 response → P/B/C/U codes), VIN assembly (mode 09 PID 02 multi-line). Unlocks ~80% of aftermarket OBD dongles (OBDLink, Vgate, generic clones). Wave 2 Builder. 52 tests. |
| 136 | CAN bus protocol implementation | ✅ | New `hardware/protocols/can.py` (~470 LoC). ISO 15765-4 over `python-can` (any backend — SocketCAN/PCAN/Vector/Kvaser/slcan/Peak). Hand-rolled ISO-TP (not `python-can-isotp` — fewer Windows-fragile deps). Services: mode 03 DTCs, mode 04 clear (`True` on positive, `False` on NRC 0x22, raises on others), mode 09 VIN, read_pid with big-endian byte combination. New `can = ["python-can>=4.0"]` optional extras. Target bikes: 2011+ Harley Touring, modern CAN-equipped Japanese/EU bikes. Wave 2 Builder. 38 tests. |
| 137 | K-line/KWP2000 protocol implementation | ✅ | New `hardware/protocols/kline.py` (~670 LoC) — ISO 14230-4 over pyserial for 90s/2000s Japanese sport-bikes (CBR/ZX/GSX-R/YZF-R1) and vintage Euro (Aprilia RSV, Ducati 996, KTM LC4). Module-level pure `_build_frame`/`_parse_frame` helpers for testability. Slow-baud wakeup, checksum validation, local-echo cancellation, strict timing windows. Services 0x10/0x11/0x14/0x18/0x1A/0x21. DTC decode (`(0x02, 0x01) → P0201`). Write services (0x27/0x2E/0x31) deliberately out of scope (tune-writing safety). Wave 2 Builder. 44 tests. |
| 138 | J1850 protocol implementation | ✅ | New `hardware/protocols/j1850.py` (~600 LoC) — J1850 VPW (10.4 kbps) for pre-2011 Harley. No direct bit-bang; talks through bridge devices (ScanGauge II, Daytona Twin Tec, Dynojet Power Commander, Digital Tech II clones). Multi-module DTC read merges ECM (P-codes) + BCM (B-codes) + ABS (C-codes) into single list, with supplementary `read_dtcs_by_module() -> dict`. Bridge variants: `daytona/scangauge/dynojet/generic`. `read_pid` raises `NotImplementedError` (Phase 141); `read_vin` raises `UnsupportedCommandError` (pre-2008 HDs lacked Mode 09). Wave 2 Builder. 27 tests. |
| 139 | ECU auto-detection + handshake | ✅ | New `hardware/ecu_detect.py` (~460 LoC). `AutoDetector` given a serial port + optional `make_hint` tries protocol adapters in priority order (Harley→J1850 first; Japanese→CAN/KWP2000; European→CAN/KWP2000; unknown→all four) until one negotiates. Per-protocol `_build_adapter` factory handles non-uniform adapter kwargs (each of CAN/K-line/J1850/ELM327 has different constructor signature). Lazy per-adapter imports so missing optional deps only surface when tried. `identify_ecu()` probes VIN + ECU part number + software version + supported OBD modes, each best-effort. `NoECUDetectedError` carries `port`, `make_hint`, and `errors: list[(name, exception)]` for introspection. No live hardware — all tests use `MagicMock` adapters. Wave 3 Builder. 31 tests. |
| 140 | Fault code read/clear operations | ✅ | First user-facing Track E phase. New `motodiag hardware` CLI group with `scan` (auto-detect + Mode 03 read + Rich table with 3-tier DTC enrichment), `clear` (Mode 04 with yellow safety warning + confirm/`--yes`), `info` (`identify_ecu()` → Rich Panel with VIN/ECU#/sw/modes). 5 new files: `hardware/mock.py` (249 LoC `MockAdapter` ABC-satisfying with configurable state), `hardware/connection.py` (255 LoC `HardwareSession` context manager — real/mock/override paths + disconnect-on-exception), `knowledge/dtc_lookup.py` (147 LoC `resolve_dtc_info` with `source=db_make/db_generic/classifier` discriminator), `cli/hardware.py` (556 LoC), `test_phase140_hardware_cli.py` (40 tests across 6 classes). `--mock` flag bypasses pyserial entirely for CI/offline dev. Tenth agent-delegated phase — Builder-A's cleanest pass (no sandbox block, 40 tests in 21.24s, zero iterative fixes). 2614 total. |
| 141 | Live sensor data streaming | ✅ | New `hardware/sensors.py` (SAE J1979 PID catalog + `SensorSpec`/`SensorReading`/`SensorStreamer` one-shot iterator) + `motodiag hardware stream --port --pids --hz --duration --output` subcommand with Rich `Live` panel + optional CSV append logging. `MockAdapter.pid_values` additive kwarg. 42 tests GREEN. Bug fix #1: hz-throttle test (generator post-yield sleep semantics). |
| 142 | Data logging + recording | ✅ | Migration 016 (schema v15→v16): `sensor_recordings` + `sensor_samples` + 4 indexes (FK CASCADE). New `hardware/recorder.py` (`RecordingManager` with SQLite/JSONL split at 1000 rows, transparent load merge, linear-interp `DiffReport` via stdlib `bisect`). `motodiag hardware log {start,stop,list,show,replay,diff,export,prune}` 8-subcommand subgroup. `parquet = [pyarrow]` optional extra. 52 tests GREEN. |
| 143 | Real-time terminal dashboard | ✅ | New `hardware/dashboard.py` (1282 LoC — `DashboardApp(textual.App)` with 3-column grid + ctrl+q/ctrl+r/d/1-6 keybindings, `GaugeWidget`/`PidChart`/`DTCPanel`/`StatusBar`, `LiveDashboardSource` wrapping SensorStreamer + `ReplayDashboardSource` walking recordings). `motodiag hardware dashboard` subcommand. `dashboard = [textual>=0.40,<1.0]` optional extra. Lazy Textual import with install-hint. 46 tests GREEN. Bug fix #1: `GaugeWidget` numeric display used unclamped value. |
| 144 | Hardware simulator | ✅ | New `hardware/simulator.py` (1212 LoC — `SimulationClock` manual-tick, 9 Pydantic discriminated-union event models, `Scenario` aggregate with cross-event validators, `ScenarioLoader` from_yaml/from_recording/list_builtins, `SimulatedAdapter(ProtocolAdapter)` sibling to MockAdapter). 10 built-in YAML scenarios under `scenarios/`. `motodiag hardware simulate {list,run,validate}` + `--simulator SCENARIO` opt-in on scan/clear/info. `pyyaml>=6` base dep + `package-data` for YAMLs. 81 tests GREEN. Bug fix #1: `_coerce_pid` bare-number → decimal (JSON round-trip identity). |
| 145 | Adapter compatibility database | ✅ | Migration 017 (schema v16→v17): `obd_adapters` + `adapter_compatibility` + `compat_notes` + 6 indexes. New `hardware/compat_repo.py` (870 LoC CRUD + ranking + `check_compatibility` specificity match + `protocols_to_skip_for_make` AutoDetector filter hook) + `compat_loader.py` (idempotent JSON seed). Seed data: 24 real adapters (OBDLink MX+/SX/LX, Dynojet PV3, Daytona TCFI, Vance & Hines FP4, Autel AP200BT, Foxwell NT301, Vgate iCar Pro, HD Digital Tech II, 24 total) + 110 compat matrix rows + 12 curated notes. `motodiag hardware compat {list,recommend,check,show,note,seed}`. AutoDetector gets `compat_repo=None` kwarg (Phase 139 backward-compat preserved). 57 tests GREEN. Bug fix #1: TestCompatCLI fixture three-layer db_path redirect. Bug fix #2: compat_notes.json `obdlink-cx` → `scantool-obdlink-cx` slug. |
| 146 | Connection troubleshooting + recovery | ✅ | `hardware/connection.py` +446 LoC: `RetryPolicy` Pydantic model (exponential-with-clamp backoff) + `ResilientAdapter` wrapper (retries transient wire ops, never retries `UnsupportedCommandError`/`NoECUDetectedError`/`clear_dtcs`) + `HardwareSession` `retry_policy`/`auto_reconnect` kwargs + `try_reconnect()` helper. AutoDetector `verbose` + `on_attempt` callback kwargs. `MockAdapter.flaky_rate` + `flaky_seed` for deterministic retry tests. `motodiag hardware diagnose` 5-step troubleshooter (port open / ATZ probe / AutoDetector negotiate / VIN read / DTC scan) with mechanic-readable Rich-panel remediation. `--retry`/`--no-retry` on scan/info (default on), clear (default off). 56 tests GREEN. Bug fix #1: `MockAdapter` lazy-import in diagnose `--mock` branch. Bug fix #2: `--retry`/`--simulator` mutex → silent retry=False. |
| 147 | Gate 6 — Hardware integration test | ✅ | **GATE 6 PASSED — Track E closed.** New `tests/test_phase147_gate_6.py` (875 LoC, 8 tests across 3 classes, zero production code). Class A: one big CliRunner workflow — `garage add` → `compat seed/recommend` → `hardware info/scan --simulator` → `hardware log start/list/show/replay/export` → `hardware stream` → `hardware diagnose --mock` → `hardware clear --simulator`. Shared DB fixture + 3 defensive AI mocks + `time.sleep` no-ops. Class B: 4 surface tests verify 9-subcommand registration + subgroup children + `--help` + submodule import graph. Class C: 3 regression tests — subprocess re-runs of Gate 5 + Gate R + tiered schema floor `>= 15/16/17`. 8 tests GREEN. Bug fix #1: `CliRunner(mix_stderr=False)` removed in Click 8.2+. Bug fix #2: `FROM recordings` → `FROM sensor_recordings`. |

## Track F — Advanced Diagnostics (Phases 148–159)

Power features for experienced mechanics. Shifted from 136-147 due to Retrofit track insertion.

| Phase | Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 148 | Predictive maintenance | ✅ | **First Track F phase.** Promotes `advanced` package Scaffold → Active. New `advanced/models.py` (frozen Pydantic v2 `FailurePrediction` + `PredictionConfidence` enum), `advanced/predictor.py` (395 LoC — `predict_failures(vehicle, horizon_days, min_severity, db_path)` with 4-pass candidate retrieval, match-tier scoring exact_model=1.0/family=0.75/make=0.5/generic=0.3, severity-keyed heuristic onset critical=15k/high=30k/medium=50k/low=80k mi, mileage + age scoring bonuses, Forum-tip-precedence `preventive_action` extraction, `verified_by` substring heuristic, horizon/severity filters, stable sort cap 50). `motodiag advanced predict --bike SLUG \| --make/--model/--year/--current-miles [--horizon-days] [--min-severity] [--json]`. Zero migration, zero AI, zero live tokens. 44 tests GREEN. |
| 149 | Wear pattern analysis | ✅ | File-seeded 30-pattern `advanced/wear.py` with overlap-ratio scoring. Mechanic symptom vocabulary ("tick of death" / "chain slap on decel" / "dim headlight"). Substring-either-direction matching. `motodiag advanced wear --bike SLUG --symptoms ...`. 33 tests GREEN. |
| 150 | Fleet management | ✅ | Migration 018: `fleets` + `fleet_bikes` tables. `advanced/fleet_repo.py` (12 CRUD) + `fleet_analytics.py` (Phase 148/149 rollups). `motodiag advanced fleet {create,list,show,add-bike,remove-bike,rename,delete,status}` (8 subcommands). 35 tests GREEN. |
| 151 | Maintenance scheduling | ✅ | Migration 019: `service_intervals` + `service_interval_templates` (44 seeded). `advanced/schedule_repo.py` + `scheduler.py` dual-axis (miles OR months) with month-end clamp. `motodiag advanced schedule {init,list,due,overdue,complete,history}`. 37 tests GREEN. |
| 152 | Service history + monotonic mileage | ✅ | Migration 020: `service_history` + `vehicles.mileage` column. `advanced/history_repo.py` with monotonic mileage bump. `predictor.py` +0.05 bonus when `mileage_source='db'`. `motodiag advanced history {add,list,show,show-all,by-type}`. 35 tests GREEN. |
| 153 | Parts cross-reference | ✅ | Migration 021: `parts` + `parts_xref` tables. `advanced/parts_repo.py` + `parts_loader.py` with OEM ↔ aftermarket catalog. `predictor.py` populates `parts_cost_cents` on FailurePrediction. `motodiag advanced parts {search,xref,show,seed}`. 31 tests GREEN. |
| 154 | OEM Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) | ✅ | Migration 022: `technical_service_bulletins` with SQL LIKE `model_pattern` + partial unique index. `advanced/tsb_repo.py` (466 LoC) + 44 real HD/Honda/Yamaha entries seeded. Auto-seed on `init_db()`. `predictor.py` `applicable_tsbs` via 4-char token overlap + severity bucket-adjacency. `motodiag advanced tsb {list,search,show,by-make}`. 32 tests GREEN. |
| 155 | NHTSA safety recalls | ✅ | Migration 023: extends `recalls` with nhtsa_id/vin_range/open + new `recall_resolutions` junction. `advanced/recall_repo.py` (603 LoC) with VIN validation + range check + WMI decode + resolutions. `predictor.py` `applicable_recalls` + critical-severity escalation. `motodiag advanced recall {list,check-vin,lookup,mark-resolved}`. 31 tests GREEN. |
| 156 | Comparative diagnostics | ✅ | No migration. `advanced/comparative.py` (709 LoC) two-stage reduction — per-recording summary → percentile across recordings. `--peers-min 5` noisy-stats guard. 200-row cohort cap. `motodiag advanced compare {bike,recording,fleet}`. 34 tests GREEN. |
| 157 | Healthy baselines | ✅ | Migration 024: `baselines` table with per-(make, model, year, pid) percentile statistics aggregated from mechanic-flagged-healthy recordings. `motodiag advanced baseline {show,flag-healthy,rebuild,list}`. 31 tests GREEN. |
| 158 | Sensor drift tracking | ✅ | No migration. `advanced/drift.py` (597 LoC) stdlib mean-of-products linear regression. Flags drifting >5%/30d slow / ≥10%/30d fast. O2 aging / coolant silting / battery decay. Unicode sparkline + CSV export. `predictor.py` opt-in `_apply_drift_bonus` (capped +0.1). `motodiag advanced drift {bike,show,recording,plot}`. 39 tests GREEN. |
| 159 | Gate 7 — Advanced diagnostics integration test | ✅ | **GATE 7 PASSED — Track F closed.** `tests/test_phase159_gate_7.py` (8 tests): end-to-end workflow across all 10 advanced subgroups + surface breadth + Gate 5/6 subprocess re-runs. 3349/3351 full regression passing. Zero new production code. |

## Track G — Shop Management + Optimization (Phases 160–174)

Shop-level features: log bikes in your shop, track issues across the fleet, triage what to fix first, auto-generate parts lists, optimize workflow. Shifted from 148-162 due to Retrofit track insertion.

| Phase | Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 160 | Shop profile + multi-bike intake | ✅ | Migration 025: `shops` + `intake_visits` tables. `shop/shop_repo.py` (337 LoC, 11 fns + hours_json validator) + `shop/intake_repo.py` (481 LoC, guarded `open→closed\|cancelled→(reopen)→open` lifecycle). `cli/shop.py` (1003 LoC) new top-level `motodiag shop` group with 3 subgroups × 22 subcommands — `profile` (5), `customer` (9, first CLI for Phase 113 dormant `crm/`), `intake` (8). 44 tests GREEN. Zero AI. |
| 161 | Work order system | ✅ | Migration 026: `work_orders` table with denormalized shop_id/vehicle_id/customer_id + intake_visit_id FK SET NULL + 4 indexes. `shop/work_order_repo.py` (748 LoC, 14 fns + 7 dedicated lifecycle transitions + guarded `draft→open→in_progress→(on_hold\|completed\|cancelled)→(reopen)→open` + composable list filters). `cli/shop.py` +473 LoC = `motodiag shop work-order {create,list,show,update,start,pause,resume,complete,cancel,reopen,assign,unassign}` (12 subcommands). 47 tests GREEN. Forward-compat bug fix: Phase 160 + Phase 161 rollback tests migrated to `rollback_to_version` pattern after Phase 161 FK broke Phase 160's bare-drop test. |
| 162 | Issue logging + categorization | ✅ | Migration 027: `issues` table (work_order_id FK CASCADE + symptoms/sessions FK SET NULL + self-referencing duplicate_of FK) with **12-category CHECK** (engine/fuel/electrical/cooling/exhaust/transmission/brakes/suspension/drivetrain/tires_wheels/accessories/rider_complaint/other — Domain-Researcher override from default 7) + 4-tier severity + 4-state guarded lifecycle + 5 indexes. `shop/issue_repo.py` (720 LoC, 14 fns + crosswalk dict for Phase 163 AI categorization). `cli/shop.py` +656 LoC = `motodiag shop issue {add,list,show,update,resolve,reopen,mark-duplicate,mark-wontfix,categorize,link-dtc,link-symptom,stats}` (12 subcommands). 42 tests GREEN. mark-wontfix requires audit-trail notes; linked_dtc_code soft-validates to survive seed reloads; duplicate_of cycle prevention via one-hop canonical check. |
| 163 | Repair priority scoring | ✅ | First Track G AI phase. Composes against Phase 162.5 `shop/ai_client.py` (zero direct anthropic imports — anti-regression grep test enforced). New `shop/priority_scorer.py` (311 LoC) + `shop/priority_models.py` (82 LoC). 4-tier rubric (CRITICAL safety / HIGH ridability / MEDIUM service / LOW cosmetic) + wait-time aging + customer-history bonus baked into cached system prompt. Mechanic-intent preservation: AI overwrites work_orders.priority ONLY when confidence > 0.75; below threshold logs to ai_response_cache (kind='priority_score') without DB mutation. Safety override + `--force` escape hatch. Write-back via Phase 161 `update_work_order` whitelist (never raw SQL). Per-call cap 3¢ + session budget 50¢ default. CLI: `motodiag shop priority {score, rescore-all, show, budget}`. 26 tests GREEN; injection seam pattern (`_default_scorer_fn=None`) is canonical Track G AI test convention. Zero schema migration. |
| 164 | Automated triage queue | ✅ | Migration 028: `ALTER TABLE shops ADD COLUMN triage_weights TEXT` (nullable). Pure query-synthesis + deterministic scoring over Phase 161/162/163; soft-guards Phase 165 via `importlib.util.find_spec("motodiag.shop.parts_needs")`. New `shop/triage_queue.py` (365 LoC) — `build_triage_queue` + `ShopTriageWeights` + `TriageItem` + 5 mutators + `ShopTriageError`. Triage formula = priority + wait + parts + urgent_flag - skip_penalty (per-shop tunable). Markers ride on `work_orders.description` via `[TRIAGE_URGENT] ` / `[TRIAGE_SKIP: reason] ` prefix tokens (idempotent, parser-anchored). CLI: `motodiag shop triage {queue, next, flag-urgent, skip, weights}`. 32 tests GREEN. |
| 165 | Parts needed aggregation | ✅ | Migration 029: 3 new tables (work_order_parts + parts_requisitions + parts_requisition_items). Bridges Phase 153 parts catalog (`parts` + `parts_xref`) to Phase 161 work_orders via FK reuse — zero schema duplication. New `shop/parts_needs.py` (605 LoC, 18 fns including 5 CRUD + 3 lifecycle + critical `_recompute_wo_parts_cost` helper that writes back via Phase 161 `update_work_order` whitelist — NEVER raw SQL, verified by mock-patch audit test). **Phase 164 contract satisfied automatically:** `list_parts_for_wo(wo_id, db_path=None)` exported with the exact name 164's soft-guard imports. Immutable requisition snapshots (`build_requisition` freezes header + items at creation; validates wo_ids belong to shop_id). OEM/aftermarket cost columns via `parts_repo.get_xrefs`. CLI: `motodiag shop parts-needs {add, list, consolidate, mark-ordered, mark-received, requisition {create, list, show}}` (8 subcommands). 38 tests GREEN. |
| 166 | Parts sourcing + cost optimization | ✅ | Second Track G AI phase. Composes against Phase 162.5 ShopAIClient (zero direct anthropic imports, anti-regression grep test). Migration 030: single `sourcing_recommendations` audit table. New `shop/sourcing_models.py` (65 LoC) + `shop/parts_sourcing.py` (482 LoC, recommend_source + get_recommendation + sourcing_budget). System prompt baked from Domain-Researcher pricing brief — decision tree + 6-tier vendor taxonomy + counter-intuitive aftermarket wins (Ricks stators, EBC HH pads). Append-only audit log with cache_hit separate from cost_cents. CLI: `motodiag shop sourcing {recommend, show, budget}`. 27 tests GREEN. `optimize_requisition` + `compare` deferred to Phase 169. |
| 167 | Labor time estimation | ✅ | Third Track G AI phase. Composes against Phase 162.5 ShopAIClient (zero direct anthropic imports) + writes back via Phase 161 update_work_order whitelist (zero raw SQL) — both enforced by anti-regression grep tests. Migration 031: `labor_estimates` audit history table with full breakdown + alternatives + environment notes. Math-consistency guard rejects AI output where adjusted ≠ base*(1+skill)*(1+mileage); retry at temp 0.1 on first mismatch. System prompt baked from Domain-Researcher pricing brief (labor norms + per-platform adjustments + skill/mileage multipliers). Reconciliation is pure arithmetic at ±20% threshold. CLI: `motodiag shop labor {estimate, bulk, show, history, reconcile, budget}`. 33 tests GREEN (incl. 2 anti-regression grep tests). |
| 168 | Bay/lift scheduling | ✅ | Migration 032: `shop_bays` + `bay_schedule_slots` tables + 4 indexes. Stdlib-only deterministic scheduling engine in `shop/bay_scheduler.py` (702 LoC): greedy next-free-window auto-assign with level-loading tie-break + overrun detection at 25% buffer + sweep-line conflict detection (≥15min = error) + utilization tracking + `optimize_shop_day(random_seed)` deterministic for per-shop-per-day reproducibility. FK asymmetry: `work_order_id SET NULL` on slots preserves utilization history through WO deletion (load-bearing for Phase 171 analytics). CLI: `motodiag shop bay {add, list, show, deactivate, schedule, reschedule, conflicts, optimize, utilization, calendar}` (10 subcommands). 37 tests GREEN. **Closes Track G deterministic core (161/162/164/165/168) alongside AI phases (163/166/167) + 162.5.** |
| 169 | Revenue tracking + invoicing | ✅ | Micro-migration 033: single `invoices.work_order_id` column + index. **Zero new tables — reuses Phase 118 `invoices` + `invoice_line_items` + `accounting.invoice_repo`.** `shop/invoicing.py` (~496 LoC): `generate_invoice_for_wo` (labor from Phase 167 actual_hours fallback estimated; parts lines from Phase 165 installed+received; tax + shop-supplies pct/flat + optional diagnostic fee stacking), `mark_invoice_paid`, `void_invoice` (enables regen via `-Rn` invoice-number suffix), `get_invoice_with_items`, `list_invoices_for_shop`, `revenue_rollup` (shop-scoped or all-shops). CLI: `motodiag shop invoice {generate, list, show, mark-paid, void, revenue}` (6 subcommands). 32 tests GREEN. **Track G commercial core closes: intake→triage→WO→parts→labor→bay→completion→invoice→revenue all through `motodiag shop *`.** |
| 170 | Customer communication | ✅ | Migration 034: `customer_notifications` table with 4 FKs + 2 CHECK constraints + 3 indexes. `shop/notification_templates.py` (~265 LoC): 23 templates across 10 events × 2-3 channels (email/sms/in_app); content baked from motorcycle-mechanic feedback (first-name recipient, WO# + shop phone everywhere, plain language, prominent totals). `shop/notifications.py` (~510 LoC): 8 public APIs with guarded `pending → sent\|failed\|cancelled` lifecycle; `resend_notification` creates new pending row preserving failure audit. **Queue-only — actual email/SMS delivery deferred to Track J transport.** CLI: `motodiag shop notify {trigger, preview, list, mark-sent, mark-failed, cancel, resend, templates}` (8 subcommands). 32 tests GREEN single-pass. Total shop CLI: 13 subgroups, 96 subcommands. |
| 171 | Shop analytics dashboard | ✅ | Read-only deterministic rollups over Track G state. Zero migrations, zero AI. `shop/analytics.py` (~524 LoC): 10 rollup functions (throughput/turnaround/utilization/overrun/labor-accuracy/top-issues/top-parts/mechanic-perf/customer-repeat) + `dashboard_snapshot` composer that delegates to Phase 168 utilization + Phase 169 revenue without duplicating. Each rollup is a pure function returning a Pydantic summary — Phase 173 can use them as rule conditions. CLI: `motodiag shop analytics {snapshot, throughput, turnaround, utilization, overruns, labor-accuracy, top-issues, top-parts, mechanic, customer-repeat}` (10 subcommands). 31 tests GREEN. Total shop CLI: 14 subgroups, 106 subcommands. |
| 172 | Multi-mechanic assignment | ✅ | Migration 035: `shop_members` (per-shop role on Phase 112 global RBAC — user can own one shop + be tech at another) + `work_order_assignments` (audit log of reassignments preserving history). `shop/rbac.py` (~475 LoC): 14 public functions + 4 exceptions; `has_shop_permission` walks `shop_members.role → roles → role_permissions → permissions` with zero catalog duplication; `reassign_work_order` writes back via Phase 161 whitelist (no raw SQL — grep-test enforced) + guards (terminal WO raises, apprentice/non-shop mechanic raises). CLI: `motodiag shop member {add, list, set-role, deactivate, reactivate}` (5) + `work-order {reassign, assignments}` (2 new). Total shop CLI: 15 subgroups, 113 subcommands. 32 tests GREEN. |
| 173 | Workflow automation rules | ✅ | Migration 036: `workflow_rules` + `workflow_rule_runs` (audit). If-this-then-that engine composing every prior Track G primitive. **Rules are JSON data; engine is code** — operators author without code changes. 3 modules (~900 LoC): `workflow_conditions.py` (12 condition types), `workflow_actions.py` (8 action types; every mutation routes through Phase 161/162/164/170/172 whitelists — no raw SQL, grep-test enforced), `workflow_rules.py` (CRUD + evaluator + firing + audit). Fail-one-continue-rest action semantics. `build_wo_context` one-time context assembly feeds all condition evaluators (no N+1 queries). CLI: `motodiag shop rule {add, list, show, update, enable, disable, delete, fire, test, history}` (10 subcommands). 42 tests GREEN. Total shop CLI: 16 subgroups, 123 subcommands. **Track G automation pillar closes.** |
| 174 | Gate 8 — Shop management integration test | ✅ | **🎯 TRACK G CLOSED.** End-to-end integration test walking 19 steps through every Track G subgroup via CLI + repo: profile → member → customer → intake → WO → issue → parts → bay → start → reassign → notify → complete → invoice → revenue → paid → analytics → rule → audit. Plus 2 scenario tests (shop isolation; rule firing across lifecycle). `TRACK_G_SUMMARY.md` (~510 LoC) closure doc ships alongside with 14-phase inventory, 8 design pillars, mechanic workflow, Track H seeds. 5 tests GREEN in 3.25s. Full targeted regression: 653/653 GREEN across Phase 113 + 118 + 131 + 153 + Track G 160-174 + 162.5. Zero regressions. **Project version 0.10.5 → 0.11.0.** |

## Track H — API + Web Layer (Phases 175–184)

REST API for future mobile app / web dashboard. Paywall enforcement flips to HARD mode here. Shifted from 163-172 due to Retrofit track insertion.

| Phase | Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 175 | FastAPI foundation + project structure | ✅ | **🚀 TRACK H OPEN.** New `src/motodiag/api/` package (~750 LoC, 8 files): `create_app(settings, db_path_override)` factory returns fresh FastAPI instance per call; `deps.py` with `get_settings`/`get_db_path`/`get_request_id` `Depends()` providers (canonical test-override seam); `errors.py` maps **30+ Track G domain exceptions** to RFC 7807 `ProblemDetail` JSON with correct HTTP status (404/409/422/403/400/500) + request-id echo; `RequestIdMiddleware` (accepts client-supplied `X-Request-ID` or generates UUID4) + `AccessLogMiddleware`; `/healthz` DB connectivity probe + `/v1/version` contract endpoint + `/v1/shops/{id}` smoke route proving full DI chain end-to-end; `motodiag serve [--host X --port N --reload --workers N]` uvicorn launcher. CORS wired with mechanic-friendly dev defaults (localhost:3000 + 5173). Lazy Track G imports keep app-creation fast. 26 tests GREEN single-pass. Targeted regression: 679/679 GREEN. **FastAPI 0.136 + uvicorn 0.45. Project version 0.11.0 → 0.11.1.** |
| 176 | Auth + API keys | ✅ | **💰 MONETIZATION GATE SHIPPED.** Stripe-style `mdk_live_*` API keys (sha256-hashed, plaintext returned once) + in-memory token-bucket rate limiter (per-tier budgets, X-RateLimit-* headers, 429 with Retry-After) + `BillingProvider` ABC with FakeBillingProvider (tests) + StripeBillingProvider (prod, lazy stripe-lib import) + Stripe webhook endpoint with HMAC + event_id idempotency + 4 FastAPI deps (`get_api_key`/`require_api_key`/`get_current_user`/`require_tier(T)`) + 402 Payment Required semantics for tier insufficient + 2 CLI subgroups (`apikey` + `subscription`, 9 subcommands total). Migration 037: new api_keys + stripe_webhook_events + extends Phase 118 subscriptions with 6 Stripe cycle columns (reuse-substrate pattern). 58 tests GREEN. Targeted regression 736/736. **Project version 0.11.1 → 0.12.0. moto-diag is now a real paywalled API service.** |
| 177 | Vehicle endpoints | ✅ | First full-CRUD Track H domain router. `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /v1/vehicles*` exposes Phase 04 vehicles via HTTP with owner scoping (`vehicles.owner_user_id` retrofit, migration 038) + tier-gated quotas (individual=5, shop=50, company=unlimited; 402 when exceeded). 7 new `_for_owner` repo helpers (Phase 112 retrofit pattern) + 6 HTTP endpoints + 4 Pydantic schemas with `Literal[...]` field validation. Cross-user 404 (not 403) for enumeration prevention. List response includes tier + quota_limit + quota_remaining. 33 tests GREEN single-pass. Targeted regression 784/784. Unscoped CLI + background jobs continue to work. **Project version 0.12.0 → 0.12.1.** |
| 178 | Diagnostic session endpoints | ✅ | 9 endpoints over `/v1/sessions*` exposing Phase 07 diagnostic_sessions with owner scoping + monthly quota (individual=50/mo, shop=500/mo, company=unlimited). **Zero migration** — Phase 112 retrofit already added user_id. 11 `_for_owner` repo helpers + Lifecycle transitions as dedicated POSTs (close/reopen). 35 tests GREEN single-pass. Focused regression 168/168 GREEN. **Project version 0.12.1 → 0.12.2.** |
| 179 | Knowledge base endpoints | ✅ | Smallest Track H domain router (310 LoC, 17 tests, <1hr). 7 endpoints over `/v1/kb/*`: DTC lookup + search, symptom search, known-issue search + detail, unified search (via Phase 09 `search_all`), DTC categories list. **Zero migration, zero tier gating** — KB is a core product feature; any authenticated caller gets in. Limit capped at 200. 17 tests GREEN single-pass. Project version 0.12.2 → 0.12.3. |
| 180 | Shop management endpoints | ✅ | Biggest pure-composer Track H router (838 LoC, 24 endpoints, 22 tests). **Zero migration.** Maps Track G's 16-subgroup CLI console onto `/v1/shop/*` HTTP across 9 sub-surfaces (profile/members/customers/intake/work-orders/issues/invoices/notifications/analytics). All routes require `require_tier("shop")` + Phase 172 shop membership. `TransitionAction` Literal dispatches all 7 WO lifecycle states through one POST. Cross-shop = 403 (not 404 — shops are global-registry). Pragmatic omissions: parts/sourcing/labor/bay/triage/priority/rules deferred to Phase 181+. **Track H scorecard: 6 phases done, 51 endpoints across 8 sub-surfaces.** Project version 0.12.3 → 0.12.4. |
| 181 | WebSocket live data | ✅ | First non-CRUD Track H surface. `ws /v1/live/{session_id}` streams live OBD sensor frames (rpm / coolant_c / throttle_pct / voltage_v / ts) to authenticated + paid-tier clients, session-scoped. **New `api/routes/live.py` (462 LoC)**: `LiveReadingProvider` ABC + `FakeLiveProvider` (deterministic seeded stream) + `ConnectionManager` + `get_live_provider` env-dispatched factory (`=fake` default, `=obd` deferred to Phase 140 wiring) + six custom 4xxx close-code constants (4401 invalid key / 4402 subscription / 4404 session / 4429 rate limit / 4500 provider / 1000 normal) + `_clamp_interval` (50-10000ms) + dual-path auth (`?api_key=` query OR `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bearer.<key>` subprotocol). Route flow: accept → validate key → check active sub → check session ownership → stream loop with non-blocking client-action polling + pause/resume/set_interval_ms handling. `try/finally` guarantees provider cleanup on disconnect. Rate-limit exemption `/v1/live` defensive (BaseHTTPMiddleware skips WS). **Build deviation**: `provider_override` kwarg removed from route signature (FastAPI coerced annotated ABC into a query-param field); override moved to module-level factory for clean monkey-patching. **24 tests GREEN in 23.09s** (6 classes: FakeProvider ×5 + ModuleHelpers ×6 + WebSocketAuth ×6 + FrameStreaming ×4 + ProviderErrors ×2 + RateLimitExemption ×1). **Track H regression 175-181: 215/215 GREEN in 5m 19s, zero regressions.** No migration, schema stays at 38. **Track H scorecard: 7 phases done, 51 HTTP + 1 WS across 9 sub-surfaces.** Project version 0.12.4 → 0.12.5. |
| 182 | Report generation endpoints | ✅ | Three distinct downloadable artifacts over one renderer pipeline + one router shape. **New `motodiag/reporting/` package (832 LoC)**: `ReportRenderer` ABC + `TextReportRenderer` (stdlib-only fallback) + `PdfReportRenderer` (reportlab 4.4.10 Platypus; already installed as transitive dep; BSD-licensed) + three builders (`build_session_report_doc` / `build_work_order_report_doc` / `build_invoice_report_doc`) that hydrate a `ReportDocument` dict and raise Phase 178/172/169 domain exceptions. **6 endpoints** (3 JSON preview + 3 PDF download): `GET /v1/reports/{session,work-order,invoice}/{id}` + `/pdf`. Session reports owner-gated (no tier — DIY users get their own diagnostics on paper); WO + invoice reports `require_tier("shop")` + shop-membership. `ReportDocument` shape: dict with title/subtitle/sections/footer; sections one of `body` / `rows` / `bullets` / `table`; unknown shapes silently skipped (forward compat). `PdfReportRenderer` XML-escapes user strings so customer names with `<`, `>`, `&` don't break Paragraph rendering. New `ReportBuildError` → 500 mapping. **Build deviations**: (1) `get_dtc` returns dict not object (one-line fix); (2) `generate_invoice_for_wo` kwarg is `wo_id=` not `work_order_id=`; (3) 962 product LoC vs planned 750; (4) 33 tests vs planned 30. **33 tests GREEN in 41.62s** (7 classes). **Full Track H regression 175-182: 248/248 GREEN in 6m 36s, zero regressions.** No migration, schema stays at 38, zero AI. **Track H scorecard: 8 phases done, 57 HTTP + 1 WS across 10 sub-surfaces.** Project version 0.12.5 → 0.12.6. |
| 183 | API documentation + OpenAPI spec | ✅ | Pure spec polish — zero runtime-behavior change; only `/openapi.json` + `/docs` output changes. **New `api/openapi.py` (459 LoC)** overrides FastAPI's `openapi()` to inject `info.contact` + `info.license` (MIT + SPDX) + `servers` list + 10-entry tag catalog + `components.securitySchemes` (apiKey `X-API-Key` header + bearerAuth HTTP Bearer) + 7 reusable error responses in `components.responses.*` (401/402/403/404/422/429 with `Retry-After`/500, all `$ref` to ProblemDetail) + explicit `PROBLEM_DETAIL_SCHEMA` fallback. **Per-operation walker** attaches security + error-response refs based on tags (public `{"meta"}` + `/v1/billing/webhooks*` stay open; tier-gated `{"shop-management", "reports", "live", "vehicles", "sessions"}` get 402), path params (→ 404), and request bodies (→ 422). Result cached on `app.openapi_schema`. **New `Settings.api_servers`** (pipe/comma `url|description` syntax) + `api_servers_list` parser. **Build deviations**: (1) 459 product LoC vs planned 300 — catalogs carry informative descriptions for Swagger UI readability; (2) `TAG_CATALOG` passed via `get_openapi(tags=...)` at construction time (post-hook `app.openapi_tags` is ignored by custom overrides); (3) `api_servers` as string not JSON (pydantic-settings limitation); (4) 43 tests vs planned 20 — each catalog member + enrichment rule got isolated coverage. **43 tests GREEN in 23.16s** (8 classes). **Full Track H regression 175-183: 291/291 GREEN in 7m 01s, zero regressions.** No migration, schema unchanged at 38, zero AI. **Track H scorecard: 9 phases done, 57 HTTP + 1 WS across 10 sub-surfaces, fully-documented OpenAPI 3.1.** Project version 0.12.6 → 0.12.7. |
| 184 | Gate 9 — API integration test | ✅ | **🎯 TRACK H CLOSED.** End-to-end HTTP integration test walking intake → invoice using only Phase 175-183 endpoints. Same shape as Gate 8 but via API instead of CLI. **New `tests/test_phase184_gate9.py` (618 LoC, 10 tests, 5 classes)**: `TestGate9HappyPath` (27-step single walk: `/v1/version` → `/v1/shop/profile` → customer → vehicle → session with symptoms/DTCs/diagnosis → session PDF → KB lookups → session close → WO open/start → issue → WO complete + actual_hours → invoice generate @ $100/hr + 8.25% tax → WO PDF + invoice PDF + invoice JSON preview → analytics snapshot → listings → openapi.json sanity, asserts status + invariants at every step); `TestGate9CrossUserIsolation` (User B gets 404 on User A's vehicles + session reports); `TestGate9CrossShopIsolation` (Shop B gets 403 on Shop A's WO/invoice reports + list + create); `TestGate9OpenAPIContract` (×4 — 10 tags + 7 error responses + 2 security schemes + apiKey attached); `TestGate9AntiRegression` (SCHEMA_VERSION=38, TRACK_H_SUMMARY.md exists with "Track H closed" phrase, Phase 184 doc exists). **New `docs/phases/completed/TRACK_H_SUMMARY.md` (214 LoC)** — closure doc: 10-phase inventory + sub-surface breakdown + **8 design pillars** (auto-mapped domain exceptions / compose-don't-duplicate routers / scope-as-code / renderer ABC / spec-as-SSOT / factory-pattern transports / hard-paywall-soft-discovery / RFC 7807 + correlation IDs) + mechanic-facing workflow map + **known limitations organized by resolving future track** (Track I: signup/login/uploads/photo-ID; Track J: Redis multi-worker state + IP rate limit + notification worker + production uvicorn; post-Gate-9: OBD hardware wiring + OpenAPI docs site + PDF branding). **Build deviations**: (1) 10 tests vs planned 20 — integration-sweep shape matches Gate 8; (2) `/v1/version` shape is `{api_version, package, schema_version}` not `{version}`; (3) bootstrap via direct repo calls (Track I scope); (4) closure doc 214 LoC vs planned 180 — 8-pillar + limitations-by-future-track handoff detail. **10 tests GREEN single-pass in 18.22s.** **Full Track H regression 175-184: 301/301 GREEN in 6m 02s, zero regressions. 🎯 Track H closes green.** **Zero production code, zero migration, schema stays at 38.** **Track H final scorecard: 10 phases, 57 HTTP + 1 WS across 10 sub-surfaces, 301 tests, fully-documented OpenAPI 3.1 spec, 2 migrations (037+038), 8 codified design pillars.** Project version 0.12.7 → 0.13.0. |

## Track I — Mobile App (iOS + Android) (Phases 185–204)

**Distribution:** iOS App Store + Google Play Store (paid app or freemium)
**Framework:** React Native (single codebase → both platforms, broad device support)

Full-featured mobile app for mechanics in the field. Same capabilities as desktop — not a stripped-down version. Designed for dirty hands, loud shops, and outdoor use.

### Device Support Requirements
- **iOS:** iPhone 8 and later (iOS 15+) — covers ~99% of active iPhones
- **Android:** Android 8.0 (Oreo) and later — covers old Samsungs, budget phones, tablets
- **Screen sizes:** 4.7" to 12.9" — phone and tablet layouts
- **Orientation:** portrait default, landscape for live sensor dashboard
- **Performance:** must run smoothly on budget Android devices ($100-200 phones)

### Design Principles (Mobile)
- **Big touch targets** — fat fingers in gloves, greasy hands, minimum 48dp tap areas
- **Voice input** — describe symptoms by talking, not typing
- **Camera + video** — film running bike, photograph parts, scan VINs
- **Offline-first** — works without internet, syncs when connected
- **Bluetooth OBD** — connect to bike adapter directly from phone
- **Low bandwidth** — works on 3G/LTE, not just WiFi — compressed API responses

| Phase | Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 185 | Mobile architecture decision (React Native vs Flutter) | ✅ | **🚀 Track I opens.** First ADR for the mobile app: `docs/mobile/ADR-001-framework-choice.md` (533 LoC). **7 decisions captured**: (1) React Native bare workflow — not Expo managed (BLE + custom audio + background-mode constraints push past managed by Phase 196); (2) TypeScript strict from file one; (3) Sibling repo `moto-diag-mobile/` — not monorepo, not subdirectory (CI isolation + independent release cadence); (4) Zustand (client) + TanStack Query (server) — Redux Toolkit/MobX/Recoil/Jotai rejected; (5) `openapi-fetch` + `openapi-typescript` from Phase 183 `/openapi.json` — end-to-end type safety Pydantic→OpenAPI→RN; (6) TanStack Query `persistQueryClient` for offline reads + op-queue for writes + `react-native-keychain` for secrets + bundled DTC database asset; (7) `react-native-ble-plx` behind `ObdConnection` provider seam mirroring Phase 181 ABC pattern, `OBD_SUPPORT` compile-time feature flag for phased release. Each decision has Context / Decision / Alternatives / Consequences / Status. ADR also captures 4 reversal-condition triggers + Implementation Notes pre-scoping Phase 186 (10-step scaffold checklist). **Pure docs phase — zero code, zero tests, zero migration, schema unchanged at 38.** Track H regression unaffected. **Phase 186 awaits user scope confirmation** — new repo + CI provider + RN version decisions need sign-off. Project version 0.13.0 → 0.13.1. |
| 186 | Mobile project scaffold + CI/CD | ✅ | Shipped in `Kubanjaze/moto-diag-mobile` repo (sibling per ADR-001). RN 0.85.2 bare init · TypeScript strict · newArchEnabled=false · Android BLE permissions + `<uses-feature bluetooth_le>` · 7 src/ stubs · MIT LICENSE · 4 ADRs (repo-location / new-arch-disabled / state-deferred / ci-deferred) · Android smoke test green on Pixel 7 API 35. Build deviation: ble-plx 3.5.1 gradle gates react plugin apply behind `isNewArchitectureEnabled()`; RN 0.85 autolinking emits codegen refs unconditionally → CMake fails. Fix via in-place node_modules edit (formalized as patch-package in Phase 187). CI deferred per ADR-004 — GitHub Actions macOS runner cost hasn't been worth it yet. iOS build deferred until Mac access; Apple Developer account already enrolled. First commit `1c3b165` on `Kubanjaze/moto-diag-mobile/main`. |
| 187 | Auth + API client library | ✅ | Shipped in `Kubanjaze/moto-diag-mobile` — 5-commit feature branch rebase-merged to main (`b425e94` → `3362e8b` → `d82a91b` → `b13ebfd` → `f30246d` → `9efe35e` finalize). Real `openapi-fetch` client over committed `api-schema/openapi.json` snapshot (219.7 KB, 48 paths, Phase 183 enriched) + `src/api-types.ts` (3946 generated lines) + `react-native-keychain`-backed API key storage + `ApiKeyProvider` Context + `useApiKey` hook + paste-key modal + HomeScreen 4-section rewrite. **Pre-flight finding:** react-native-keychain@10.0.0 has the identical ble-plx gradle bug — caught + patched before install. 2 patches formalized in `patches/` (1016B + 986B, gradle-only). New ADR-005 (OpenAPI snapshot). **Architect gate GREEN (2026-04-24):** HomeScreen shows `✓ Connected · package v0.1.0 · schema v38 · api v1` + `✓ Authenticated · mdk_live_NF2a•••` + `✓ 0 vehicles · individual tier · 5/5 quota remaining` (full happy path); Keychain cold-relaunch persistence verified; Phase 186 BLE no-regression clean. **41 tests green in 0.44s.** Token refresh omitted — API keys don't expire (JWT/refresh comes in Track J signup flow). **Key finding: OpenAPI contract is executable, not descriptive** — backend Pydantic change → 2 npm commands → TypeScript errors flag every mobile screen needing refactoring. Coordination becomes propagation. Mobile package version 0.0.1 → 0.0.2. |
| 188 | Vehicle garage CRUD (VIN scanner deferred) | ✅ | Shipped in `Kubanjaze/moto-diag-mobile` — 8-commit feature branch (`phase-188-vehicle-garage`) rebase-merged to main 2026-04-26 after architect re-gate (round 1 BLOCKED with 2 bugs + 1 nit; round 2 GREEN). 5 build commits (nav scaffolding + screen stubs + Button → useVehicles + VehiclesScreen list → useVehicle(id) + VehicleDetailScreen view + delete → NewVehicleScreen form + Field/SelectField + create → VehicleDetailScreen edit + README + version 0.0.3) + 3 fix commits in response to gate findings. **Bug 1 (root cause):** Phase 187 `customFetch` was stripping `Content-Type` from POST/PATCH requests — `openapi-fetch` packs body + Content-Type into a Request object, but the wrapper read only `init.headers` (always undefined for body-bearing methods) and replaced the Request's headers per fetch spec, dropping Content-Type. Backend got body bytes with no Content-Type → 422 HTTPValidationError. GET / DELETE worked (no body, no Content-Type). Phase 187's GET-only smoke surface couldn't catch it; Phase 188's first POST + PATCH triggered it immediately. **Bug 2:** `describeError` only knew Phase 175 ProblemDetail; FastAPI's 422 uses `HTTPValidationError` (`{detail: [{loc, msg, type}, ...]}`) which fell through to `String(err)` → `[object Object]`. **Nit:** view mode showed raw enum values (`ice`, `four_stroke`); symptom of 120 lines of enum metadata duplicated across 2 screens with no shared module. All three fixed in commits 6/7/8: customFetch reads Request headers first → init.headers → auth on top; describeError checks HVE before ProblemDetail; new `src/types/vehicleEnums.ts` single source of truth + `labelFor()` helper applied in view mode. **Round-2 verification:** all 5 previously-blocked smoke steps green (POST save, PATCH save, view-mode labels, 6th-bike 402 quota copy, plus a bonus HVE 422 surfaced cleanly when free-text battery_chemistry tripped the backend enum). 90 / 90 tests green (incl. 2 commit-6 Content-Type regression guards + 17 commit-7 HVE tests). 0 Phase 186/187 regressions. Mobile package version 0.0.2 → 0.0.3. **Filed as F1 follow-up** (not blocking): battery_chemistry should be a `SelectField` not free-text — fold into Phase 189. **Key finding: transport bugs hide in GET-only test surfaces.** Phase 187's smoke was GET-only and missed the customFetch Content-Type strip; Phase 188's first POST/PATCH from the mobile UI surfaced it immediately. For the rest of Track I: every phase introducing the first body-bearing request from a new code path is implicitly a transport-regression check on Phase 187. Phase doc + log: `docs/phases/completed/188_*.md`. |
| 189 | Diagnostic session UI (mobile) | ✅ | Sessions tab + list + new session + detail (symptoms/DTCs/diagnosis/close-reopen) over Phase 178 `/v1/sessions`. First bottom-tab nav (Home/Garage/Sessions). Severity Other… round-trip per sketch sign-off. F1 (battery_chemistry SelectField) folded in as Commit 1. 7 commits, gate round 1 GREEN, 162/162 tests, mobile 0.0.3→0.0.4. (was 178; swapped with 190 at plan time so the canonical mechanic workflow lands first) |
| 190 | DTC code lookup screen | ✅ | DTCSearchScreen (HomeStack) + DTCDetailScreen (both HomeStack + SessionsStack via cross-stack same-route-name) + tap-from-SessionDetail fault-code cross-link closes Phase 189's known "raw codes only" gap. Debounced 300ms search-as-you-type with race-cancellation. Round 1 FAILED at Step 11 with 3 must-fix bugs (composite key + typed-error + seed expansion); round 2 GREEN after fix commits 6/7/8. 7 mobile + 1 backend commit, 210/210 mobile + 17/17 + 97/97 backend tests, mobile 0.0.4→0.0.5, backend 0.13.5→0.13.6.

# Expansion Tracks (Phases 211–352)

The following tracks extend MotoDiag beyond the original 210-phase core product into a complete commercial platform. Planning-only; these phases unlock once the core platform has launched and generated customer feedback to prioritize expansion.

## Track K — European Brand Coverage (Phases 211–240)

European motorcycle brands — BMW, Ducati, KTM, Triumph, Aprilia, MV Agusta. Each brand gets dedicated phases for its model lines, electrical systems, and cross-model common issues, matching the pattern established in Tracks B.

## Design Principles

1. **Core depends on nothing** — no framework imports in business logic
2. **Hardware is optional** — full diagnostic value without plugging anything in
3. **Mechanic-first UX** — terse, useful output; no fluff
4. **Every diagnosis is traceable** — session → symptoms → reasoning → conclusion
5. **Knowledge compounds** — each diagnostic session can improve future diagnoses
6. **Cost-aware AI** — track tokens, use cheapest model that works, cache aggressively
