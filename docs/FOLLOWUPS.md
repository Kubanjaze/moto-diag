# Follow-ups — backend

Findings about **backend** code: the corpus, retrieval, the CLI, the API,
migrations, the knowledge pipeline. Each entry records what was measured, why it
was not fixed where it was found, and what would close it.

## Where a finding lives

**A finding lives in the repo whose code it is about.** Backend findings here;
mobile findings in [`moto-diag-mobile/docs/FOLLOWUPS.md`](https://github.com/Kubanjaze/moto-diag-mobile/blob/main/docs/FOLLOWUPS.md).
A finding that spans both is filed once, in the repo where the fix lands, and
referenced from the other. This is stated in `ROADMAP_AUTHORITY.md`, which is
the binding contract — not in any one agent's memory.

## Numbering

**F-numbers are ONE global sequence across both files.** The next number is
`max(F across BOTH files) + 1`, never the max of one. Check both before
assigning. A number is never reused and never renumbered when a finding moves
repos.

At the time of writing the highest assigned is **F125** (this file); the mobile
file's highest is **F114**.

### F115

**A row is unreachable to the owners it was written for**

Phase 254's row 4605 explains that three unrelated components are all called a
drive belt, and that a Harley-Davidson final-drive belt is not a CVT belt. Its
`make` column reads `Piaggio, Vespa, Honda, Yamaha, Kymco, SYM, Genuine`.

Measured: `Harley-Davidson Road King` reaches row 4605 → **False**.
`BMW R1200GS` → **False**. `Yamaha Bolt` → True. `Honda PCX 150` → True.

**The row that exists to stop a Harley owner confusing two belts cannot be
retrieved by a Harley owner.** The general half is the useful half and it is
scoped to the marques that need it least. Not fixed in 255 — the row ships
unscoped on the transmission axis, which is correct, but its `make` column is a
separate defect. Splitting the general half out belongs to 255B.

### F116

**`manual` is the fifth substring collision, and the worst ratio yet**

`SELECT * FROM known_issues WHERE description LIKE '%manual%'` returns **311
rows, of which 300 are the document** — service manual, owner's manual, workshop
manual. Exactly **2** use the word in the transmission sense.

The previous four: `grommet` (Phase 250C), `symptom`/`system`/`genuine part`
(253), `controller`/`kickstand` (250B), and now `manual`. Retrieval matching on
substrings is the common cause. Phase 255 routes around it — 255B selects rows
by the transmission axis rather than by searching for the word — but the
collision itself is untouched.

### F117

**The XS650 cooling over-reach predates Phase 254**

A Yamaha XS650 — an air-cooled parallel twin — retrieves **11 liquid-cooling
rows**. This is not 254's doing; it predates it. Measured across the corpus: 67
liquid-cooling rows, 11 of them naming more than one marque.

Cooling is the third axis. It needs the same treatment the transmission axis
just received, and the mechanism is now built.

### F118

**Final drive is a fourth axis, and must not be solved with `{manual}`**

Measured on the live database:

| machine | total rows | clutch | gearbox | **final-drive chain** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Honda PCX 150 | 165 | 3 | 1 | **8** |
| Yamaha Zuma 125 | 127 | 1 | 2 | **4** |
| Kymco Agility 50 | 16 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Genuine Buddy 125 | 15 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

A PCX has no chain. Neither does a belt-drive Harley-Davidson or a shaft-drive
Gold Wing, and **those two would not be helped by a `{manual}` declaration** —
they are manual-transmission machines that still must not receive chain content.
Final drive is its own axis: chain / belt / shaft.

Recorded on the general-applicability ticket as the fourth axis.

### F119

**Honda's US scooter owner's manuals name no transmission at all**

While sourcing the Phase 255 lookup, every manufacturer document was re-read
first-hand. Honda's US-market scooter owner's manuals are the outlier:

* **2025 Ruckus owner's manual** (31GJP610, 107 pp): **zero** occurrences of
  "belt".
* **2025 Metropolitan owner's manual** (31GJB680, 124 pp): zero occurrences of
  "drive belt" or "weight roller". Only "damage to the transmission" and a
  "Transmission oil capacity" figure.

Both are CVT machines. Neither can be classified from its own owner's manual, so
**neither gets a lookup entry** and both lose the Phase 254 CVT layer. This
echoes 254's own C24 finding that Honda's CHF50 schedules the clutch shoes and
has no drive-belt row at all.

By contrast Honda's European books do say it: the PCX125 21YM and SH125i/SH150i
manuals both read *"the drive belt and weight rollers"*, and the PCX carries a
V-BELT service indicator.

**The gap is a document gap, not a knowledge gap** — which is exactly the kind
this corpus is not allowed to close by inference.

### F120

**Piaggio uses "direct drive" to mean a CVT**

The Vespa Primavera/S 150 owner's manual states:

> "The vehicle is fitted with direct drive automatic transmission."

This is a twist-and-go CVT scooter. Piaggio's "direct drive" means there is no
intermediate gearbox — it does **not** mean the `direct_drive` value of the
Phase 255 transmission enum, which is defined as no gearbox *and no clutch*. The
same manual contains **zero** occurrences of "variator", which independently
corroborates Phase 254's vocabulary row.

A documentation hazard rather than a runtime one, because nothing in the code
reads document text to classify anything. Recorded in the ADR and in the lookup
entry itself so the next author does not resolve it the wrong way.

### F121

**Mobile has no transmission field, and the residual gap is user machines**

`NewVehicleScreen.tsx:121` posts `make, model, year, engine_cc, vin, protocol,
powertrain, engine_type, battery_chemistry, motor_kw, bms_present, mileage,
notes`. No transmission. Every mobile-created vehicle lands with the column NULL
and depends entirely on the backend resolver.

Mobile already sends `powertrain` as a first-class field, so the precedent for
adding one is in the same request body.

**Named as the phase immediately after 255B**, not "later": the live `vehicles`
table holds 10 machines and none of them is a CVT machine, so the exposure is
entirely future — whatever a user adds next.

### F122

**One corrupt applicability value stops diagnosis**

Phase 255's contract says an invalid `known_issues.applicability` is **rejected
loudly** at seed load and again at read. Implementing that and then exercising
it showed what "loudly" costs at read time.

`_declared_for` raises `ApplicabilityError`, which propagates through
`compose_prompt_rows` and out of `_load_known_issues` — the retrieval path for
`motodiag diagnose` (two call sites) and `motodiag code` (one). **A single row
with `{"transmision": ["cvt"]}` stops diagnosis for every machine, not just the
one the row would have reached.**

The trade was kept deliberately. Dropping the row silently would load a typo as
*unscoped*, which puts it back in front of every Gold Wing — the exact defect
Phase 255 exists to fix, reintroduced by one character. Treating it as "applies
to nothing" would be fail-closed and safe but silent, and a corpus in a state
nobody validated is not a corpus to answer from.

Two things were changed rather than left: the error now names the offending row
by id and title, and the behaviour is pinned by a test and two mutations.

**For the operator to decide, not for a later phase to assume:** whether a read
of a corrupt corpus should stop the product or degrade to withholding the row
with a logged error. Only reachable by writing to the column outside
`add_known_issue`, which validates — a JSON column has no CHECK constraint, so
that path exists.

### F123

**`predict_failures` is a third retrieval door and still carries the Phase 254 over-reach.**

Phase 255 fixed applicability on the two paths that hand corpus rows to a model
as context about one machine: `_load_known_issues` (`motodiag diagnose`,
`motodiag code`) and the video `/ask` endpoint. **`predict_failures` is a third
and was left.**

It does not use `known_issues_for_vehicle` at all. It runs its own four-pass
`search_known_issues` retrieval — the `LIKE`-based path — dedupes by issue id,
and scores fifty predictions with drift bonuses. Measured against the live
corpus:

| machine | Phase 254 rows behind its predictions |
|---|---|
| Yamaha MT07 | **5** — 4614, 4606, 4607, 4608, 4610 |
| Yamaha XS650 | **5** — same |
| Honda GL1800 Gold Wing | **2** — 4606, 4607 |

So a Gold Wing owner still receives maintenance predictions derived from
scooter variator-roller and clutch-lining rows.

**Why it was not fixed in Phase 255.** The filter itself is a one-line call and
the machinery exists. The pipeline is not: fifty scored predictions, a separate
retrieval with four passes and its own year-window handling, drift bonuses,
recall and TSB joins. Filtering its candidate pool changes what it predicts and
by how much, and that needs a plan, a measurement of the before/after
prediction set, and a refuter. **Changing a scored pipeline late in a phase,
without those, is exactly how the Phase 254 defect shipped** — so it is filed
rather than patched.

**The general lesson is bigger than this ticket.** Phase 254 never asked which
machines would receive its rows. Phase 255 asked it, and the answer was that
there are three doors and nobody had a list of them. **There is still no test
asserting that every retrieval path applies the applicability filter** — a new
fourth door would leak silently. That guard belongs with the general
applicability mechanism.

### F125

**The ROADMAP_AUTHORITY contract drifted between its two copies, which is the drift class it exists to prevent.**

`ROADMAP_AUTHORITY.md` states: *"Identical copy committed to both repos… Do not
edit one copy without the other."* Found on 2026-09-21 while amending it:

| copy | bytes | has F54 amendment? |
|---|---|---|
| `moto-diag/ROADMAP_AUTHORITY.md` | 6,135 (pre-edit) | **yes** |
| `moto-diag-mobile/ROADMAP_AUTHORITY.md` | 5,138 (pre-edit) | **no** |

The **"Inventories are not status" amendment (added 2026-09-02 under F54)** was
committed to the backend copy only. The mobile repo carried a contract missing
one of its two amendments for **19 days**, and the mobile copy was the one a
reader in that repo would have consulted.

**Repaired** in the same commit that added the findings rule: the mobile copy
was replaced with the backend copy, and both are now byte-identical
(`md5 87f96432e7534ffd53f33b2a96f5eefa`).

**The structural point.** This contract's stated purpose is to remove a drift
class "structurally rather than relying on hand-sync discipline" — and it is
itself maintained by hand-sync discipline, which failed. The amendment
procedure requires a matched commit to both copies and nothing verifies it.

**What would close it:** a check that the two copies are byte-identical, run
where it cannot be skipped. A test in the backend suite can read the mobile
path only when both repos are checked out side by side, which is the normal
layout here but not guaranteed — so the check should skip loudly (naming why)
rather than pass when the sibling repo is absent, since a silent skip is how
this went unnoticed. **Not fixed here:** it needs a decision about where the
check runs, and a skip that is counted rather than invisible is exactly the
close-out gate discipline this project already learned once.
